                <h1>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</h1>
        <p>Ye-ha! Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Don't underestimate the Force. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
        <p>You mean it controls your actions? I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. <strong> She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.</strong> <em> Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander.</em> There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
        <h2>What!?</h2>
        <p>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</li><li>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</li><li>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</h3>
        <p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</li><li>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</li><li>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>He is here. What?! What?! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
        <p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>

        <p>I find your lack of faith disturbing. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>
        <p>You mean it controls your actions? In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>
        <p>As you wish. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>
        <p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>
        <p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Don't underestimate the Force.</p>

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
